# ugv-training-thumper
A basic repository for code relating to the Thumper training UGV.

The final code for Kitty is under final_autonomous_code.ino
This one .ino file is all you need to run Kitty. I'll get around to cleaning up this repository later.

Use that if you're going to make any changes, but do submit them to the dev branch so we don't break it. At least harder than we have already. :)
