A basic repository for code relating to Kitty, both versions 1.0 and 2.0.

The final code for Kitty 1.0 is under final_autonomous_code.ino
Load that on the Arduino and you're good to go.

**NOTE: KITTY VERSION 1.0 HAS BEEN DISASSEMBLED. THE CODE IS NEAT BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BUILD 1.0 AGAIN TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT.**

Code pieces for Kitty 2.0 will be a .py file and a .ino.

The python file (running on the Pi) will make all actual decisions, and the arduino is simply slaved to the Pi to execute those instructions.
